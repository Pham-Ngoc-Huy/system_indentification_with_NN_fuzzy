## Quantum Mechanics for Machine Learning and Neural Network Math Base for Lower Limb Exoskeleton

### Objective

- **Quantum Mechanics for Machine Learning:**  
  This topic focuses on understanding the fundamentals of `quantum computing`, including - how `qubits` are represented and manipulated using mathematical foundations such as vectors and probability theory. 
  
    => The goal is to build a simple project that demonstrates how `quantum mechanics` concepts can be applied in `machine learning` without relying on `built-in functions`, helping to develop an intuitive understanding of how quantum systems work.  
    - In this Quantum Mechanics, we will get use with Kronecker product whereas:

- **Neural Network in Lower Limb Exoskeleton:**  
  This topic focuses on understanding `mathbase` of neural network foundation and it varitations including `type 2` and `fuzzy` for the Lower Limb Exoskeleton dataset.  
  
    => The goal is to build a predicted action from the input of users to guess what is the next action (the subjects we focus on both `male` and `female` - no age limit)
